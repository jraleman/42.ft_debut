## What is 42

1. In the most concise way possible, answer this question, what is 42?
How would you describe 42 to someone who doesn’t know what 42 is?

> I would describe 42 as a tuition free coding school that revolves in a
peer-to-peer ecosystem. It is very similar to a workplace, where critical
thinking and problem solving skills go hand by hand, and a project based
curriculum that can be completed at your own pace.

2. Why are there no instructions on the initial 42 logic tests?

> A student needs to have patience, determination, intuition, and a problem
solving mindset. That’s why logic tests are simple, minimalist, and without
instructions. There are people that English is not their native language,
and it is not fair for a test to test you on some unrelated skills,
making a non-existent language barrier between the test and the candidate.

3. What are the core 42 principles?

> The school wants you to succeed.
They want you to be a better person, someone who can proudly say:
“I am a software engineer, and I am ready for any challenge”. :)
Pisciners (candidates) and cadets (students) should respect people, resources,
yourself, and think about the future. Always be perseverance, have some
discipline with a manageable schedule to allow workflow and learn at the
same time.
Diversity, morality, work ethics, and cultures… share some stories,
make new friends, and learn from them.
It is like going to a different country, within the school.

## Why 42

4. If somebody is thinking of going to 42, but has no coding
experience - do you really think it’s worth their time?

> Candidates don't need coding experience, none of us were born with
computer science knowledge. We start from the same line, but some people are
better than others, that is the harsh truth. But in no way you should be
giving up. Just keep practicing and studying, practicing and studying,
practicing and studying… you will get better. Improvements matters,
comparisons are just a reference.

5. What makes 42 unique?

> Because of the French roots of the school, it feels very unique compared to
American traditional university and schools. Xavier Niel, along with Kwame are
the responsible of making 42 School Silicon Valley a reality!
And the Bocal (the administration) cares about you.
It is a small school, feels a lot like home.

## How to succeed at 42

6. What do you think you’re learning the most at 42?

> Interestingly, what a person learn from 42 School, varies between them.
This is because, 42, is the answer to life, the universe and everything.
Yes, it is a coding school, but it is also type of vocational school.
We have musicians, professional poker players, designers, actors, painters,
and an alpaca shearer… keinen Spaß. ;)
It is very easy to make friends…
I think that is what I got more from this school.
I will always be thankful for this opportunity.

7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the
problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

> Getting myself stuck on a problem, and trying so hard to solve it,
but taking a very long time to do it is one of the worst feelings.
By contrast, solving this problem will bring you joy at the end.
It is like a video game.
It feels good.
Like beating a Contra without using the Konami Code type of good.
But if I find myself on a situation like this, I will seek for some help.
First, I will DuckDuckGo it, because screw Google.
If I can't find a solution, I will use Google because it is better.
If not avail, it's time for StackOverflow.
No solutions?
Time to go to the GitHub repository of the technology I am using and
see the issues.
Nothing?
Open an issue and cry because it will take a while for help to come to you.
But what if I can go and search for help?
That is where 42 comes into play.
By knowing the different skills of people, you know who is good with
JavaScript, Python, UI/UX design, Assembly, GraphQL, etc…

8. How will you ensure that your personal level of motivation remains high
on a daily basis to complete at least 1 level per month without the Piscine
pressure and strict deadlines?

> So… 42 School is the best school out there, right?
I don't know. But I know that 42 has some issues too, not everything is
unicorn and rainbows.
This is because for every good, there is some bad.
It is logic.
But I guess it can't be helped.
It is hard to keep motivation high when you code everyday, every time.
Without friends, without a plan, without determination, or without the thirst
for knowledge and the will to be one of the best, it is going to be hard to
keep up with the dorm requirements and the strict deadlines.
One of the reasons might be that the Piscine, the totally not boot-camp,
introductory test program that you need to complete to be accepted as a student,
is fast paced.
And the regular program is at your own pace fast.
If you are lazy, you are not going to level up in life.

## Life after 42

9. If someone asks you why it says internships are required on the 42 website,
but they do not offer job placement, what would you say?

> Internships and jobs are required at 42 School.
Maybe they want us to grow personally, get some greens, and be successful
on life?
Our foundation as a society is to contribute back, and one way to do it is
to work. The important thing is that you enjoy doing it.
It is what going to define you later in life.
If you do well in 42 School, you already are working on your teamwork,
communication, knowledge in doing research, rigor, creativity, adaptability,
and other soft skills.

10. How do the internships work? Is it mandatory that you have to reach a
certain level before leaving on an internship or can you validate it anytime
you find one?

> Of course, soft skills are important, but you are going to use your
technical skills.
Soft skills are just for help.
I see it more or less like bonus on your skill branch of yourself.
For this reason, a mandatory level should be reached before being able to
apply for an internship.
It used to be level 7, then it went to level 10,
and I think it went back to level 7?

11. How does 42 help you adapt to a work place?

> Because the school is small, growing, and just starting…
it feels a bit incomplete.
This is not a negative view at all, it is just the way the world works.
My whole life I have only went to one school, from kindergarten to high school.
I faced some similar transitions and situation that 42 School is going through.
I am a believer that 42 School has great potential, but is up to us,
the students to make it the best coding school in the entire world.
With the skills gained through the program, students will be able to adapt to a
work environment relatively fast.
